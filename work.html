        <p class="medium">Das Programm researches Braun Design 1955-1995 (the period of Dieter Rams’ directorship). Our
          activities span writing projects, exhibition curation and the supply of objects to museums – amongst others,
          the London Design Museum, Vitra Museum, Cooper Hewitt Smithsonian Design Museum and the HfG Ulm Archive.
          Stocked with over 550 Braun objects, from ‘60s audio equipment to ‘80s shavers, Das Programm’s website
          combines archive, reference book and educational resource.
          Our London seminars make use of Das Programm’s core collection and the expertise of its Director, Dr Peter
          Kapos. The objects around which seminars are constructed exist together in only a handful of places across the
          world. Using these key pieces as physical reference points, visitors are led through a history of Braun
          Design. The experience is intimate and discursive; handling is encouraged. Two seminars are currently offered
          – Braun Audio, and the Braun Programme (extending to household, photography and printed materials).
